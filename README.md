# discord.js-pagination
[saanuregh's discord.js-pagination](https://github.com/saanuregh/discord.js-pagination/) ported to TypeScript with some changes to better suit my needs

Used in [Minehut's Discord bot](https://github.com/Minehut/MinehutBOT)

## Intents
Your bot needs to receive reaction events from Discord for this library to work, so intents like `GUILD_MESSAGE_REACTIONS` or `DIRECT_MESSAGE_REACTIONS` may be required, depending on where pagination is used.
